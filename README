Grizzly-RPC

Motivation
----------

For a couple of years I was successfully using Remote Tea [1] RPC implementation.
The Remote Tea library was implemented for java 1.2. Since then java got NIO and
concurrent utilities. Those features allow to write highly salable RPC applications.
I pick Grizzly[2] NIO framework to not re-implement NIO stack myself. After several
attempts to port Remote Tea to Grizzly I finally decided to write my own RPC server
engine by reusing as much as possible of original Remote Tea code. Technically, this
is not a fork of Remote Tea RPC library, but formally it is as I was inspired by
Remote Tea RPC and took lot of ideas from it including xdr language parser. The
goal to be able to use stubs generated by Remote Tea ( I do not want to rewrite
my RPC server once more ).
